# Hi, Iâ€™m Nick. 
I'm a technical writer and editor. Since 2020, I've been learning how to design and program web apps. You'll find some of my projects here (or the ones I cared to create repos for, anyways).

As of December 2021, I've been branching out my studies into other areas of computer science, such as computer architecture and networking. You can follow along as I stumble my way through courses on these subjects!

Aside from tech, I also love movies. Check out my Films repo to find out my favorites!

As an editor, a (hobbyist) programmer, and a fan of clean lines, I'll leave on a quote that's oft-attributed to Albert Einstein:

> Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.
